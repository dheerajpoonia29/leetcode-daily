	1.	Traversal & Basic Operations
Simple loop, sum, min/max, reverse.
Practice: Linear search, reverse array.
	2.	Frequency & Counting
Count occurrences, find duplicates, unique elements.
Practice: Frequency array, majority element (basic).
	3.	Two Pointer Pattern
Use left–right pointers to reduce complexity.
Practice: Move zeroes, remove duplicates, reverse array.
	4.	Sliding Window
Window of size k to optimize subarray problems.
Practice: Max sum subarray of size k.
	5.	Prefix Sum
Precompute sums to answer range queries fast.
Practice: Range sum queries, equilibrium index.
	6.	Kadane’s Algorithm
Best for maximum subarray problems.
Practice: Maximum subarray sum.
	7.	Sorting + Arrays
Sort then solve logically.
Practice: Merge sorted arrays, sort 0s 1s 2s.
	8.	Hashing with Arrays
Use map/set to optimize search.
Practice: Two Sum, first repeating element.
	9.	Subarrays Thinking
Understand all possible subarrays.
Practice: Count subarrays with given sum (basic).
	10.	Greedy on Arrays
Local best → global best.
Practice: Buy & sell stock, jump game.
